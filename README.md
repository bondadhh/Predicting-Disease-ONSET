# Predicting-Disease-ONSET

Built XG Boost Model to predict the disease ONSET of certain patients based on their clinical attributes. 

I have performed exploratory data analysis on the data to get a good understanding on how they are related to each other, performed feature engineering such as one hot encoding of the categorical variables. 

Finally built XG Boost algorithm to classify if the patient has cardiovascular disease or not. Tuned various hyper parameters in the XG Boost algorithm space to yeild the best result. 

The model performed well with an AUC score of approximately 80%, precision 75% and Recall 69%
